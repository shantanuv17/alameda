<P style="font-size:24pt; bold">Alameda Installation Guide for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform</p>

# Prerequisites
1. **Platform Requirement**

   OpenShift Container Platform

2. **OpenShift Cluster Admin User**

   A user bound with the "cluster-admin" role is needed for deployment (no longer needed afterward)
   ```
   $ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin <user_name>
   ```

3. **OpenShift Persistent Volumes**

   Cluster admin needs to prepare **3 Persistent Volumes (PV)** to serve **3 Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)** made by Alameda at deployment. The PVs need to meet following requirements:

   **Note:** We suggest specifying **persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy** of PV as **Retain**

   * **InfluxDB PV**:
	  1. Access Mode: ReadWriteOnce
	  2. Capacity: Meets requirement for PVC capacity inputed during deployment (at least 10GiB)
	  3. Label: Set up PV label "**storage-name: alameda-influxdb**"

	  Example:
	  ```
      metadata:
        name: pv1
        labels:
          storage-name: alameda-influxdb
	  ```
   * **Alameda-AI PV**:
	  1. Access Mode: ReadWriteOnce
	  2. Capacity: Meets requirement for PVC capacity inputed during deployment (at least 10GiB)
	  3. Label: Set up PV label "**storage-name: alameda-ai**"

   Note: Check **Alameda Installation step 7** for details about specifying PVCs capacity to meet the PVs created here.
# Alameda Installation

1. Go to the OpenShift web console and login using a user with the **cluster-admin** role binding.

2. Create a project. (ex: alameda)
	
	![](./img/openshift_guide/1.png)
	
3. Select the newly created project and choose **Import YAML/JSON**.
	
	![](./img/openshift_guide/2.png)
	
4. Download alameda.yml from our github [openshift/template/deploy/](../openshift/template/deploy/) and either upload the file or just directly paste the content into the text area.

	![](./img/openshift_guide/3.png)
	
5. De-select **Process the template**, select **Save template**.
	
	![](./img/openshift_guide/4.png)
	
6. After you've finished importing, go to ***Catalog*** in the sidebar, and you should see the **Federator.ai** icon.
	
	![](./img/openshift_guide/5.png)
	
7. Click on the Federator.ai icon then click Next. Fill in the project where alameda will be deployed as **Alameda namespace** (ex. alameda) - note this needs to match the current project being accessed. You will need to obtain the **DockerHub config json** secret key and **Alameda image tag** from a ProphetStor sales representative. 

   You can also specify the three PVC capacities, but remember to match the PVs size described in our **Prerequisites** section.

8. Click **Continue Anyway** to acknowledge the warning.
	
	![](./img/openshift_guide/7.png)
	
9. Go to ***Overview*** to see the deployment take effect.
	
	![](./img/openshift_guide/8.png)
	
10. Write down the following three values from prometheus.yaml.

	| Name | Value (example)|
	| --- | --- |
	| url | https://prometheus-k8s.openshift-monitoring.svc:9091 |
	| basicAuthUser | internal |
	| basicAuthPassword | ******* |
	
	![](./img/openshift_guide/10.png)
	
11. Go to **Configuration > Data Sources** and click on the **Add data source** button. Select Promethues and fill in the previously recorded url, select **Basic Auth** and fill in AuthUser and AuthPassword. Also, remember to check **Skip TLS verify**. Click the **Save & Test** button.

# Alameda Configuration

1. Go to the project where you would like resource predictions and recommendations. Go to its **Deployment or DeploymentConfig** and view the yaml file. Record the labels section of Deployment or DeploymentConfig (ex: **app: ocp-smoke-test**) 
	
	![](./img/openshift_guide/16.png)
	
	![](./img/openshift_guide/17.png)
	
2. Click on **Add to Project** and select **Import YAML/JSON**.
	
	![](./img/openshift_guide/18.png)
	
3. Put in the following yaml information to tell **AlamedaScaler** which Deployment/DeploymentConfig is applicable and click the **Create** button. (Click **Continue Anyway** to acknowledge the warning.)

	```
	apiVersion: autoscaling.containers.ai/v1alpha1
	kind: AlamedaScaler
	metadata:
	    name: alameda
	    namespace: ocp-smoke-test #(YOUR_PROJECT_NAME)
	spec:
	    policy: stable
	    enable: true
	    selector:
	        matchLabels:
	            app: ocp-smoke-test #(Your Deployment/DeploymentConfig labels)
	```
![](./img/openshift_guide/19.png)

4. Use the following oc command to check if **AlamedaScaler** successfully found the pods under the desired project. You will see **deploymentconfigs:{}** and **deployments:{}** if the AlamedaScaler didn't find any applicable pods.

	```
	oc get alamedascaler -o yaml
	```
